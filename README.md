# Link-State-Routing-Protocol-


This link state rrouting protocol emulator is written in Java and compiled using maven. We have six router configurations with identifiable characteristics: the simulated IP address and the port number. Each router can connect to the other and send two types of packets, the first being the "Hello" message and the second one being the "LSAUpdate" message. LSA is Link State Advertisement. A link is a connection between two Router instances. Each router has a Link State Database, which stores the information on the network's topology. This topology updates when we create a link; the routers in the new link send 'LSAUpdate' packets to their neighbors. The neighboring routers use this information to update their Link State Database. This database helps us find the shortest path to a given simulated IP address from any router. Each link in this network has a weight (which simulates the real-world cost of sending packets from one host to another). Knowing the cost between each link, the routers can find the shortest path to a given simulated IP; this is implemented using Dijkstra's algorithm.
